### **Method 2: Using SQL Commands**

#### **Step 1: Create Streamlit App**
```sql
USE DATABASE CUSTOMER_360_DB;
USE SCHEMA PUBLIC;

CREATE OR REPLACE STREAMLIT customer_360_ai_assistant
ROOT_LOCATION = '@CUSTOMER_360_STAGE'
MAIN_FILE = 'customer_360_sis_app.py'
QUERY_WAREHOUSE = 'CUSTOMER_360_WH';
```

#### **Step 2: Upload Files to Stage**
```sql
-- First, put the file in the stage
PUT file://customer_360_sis_app.py @CUSTOMER_360_STAGE overwrite=true;

-- Verify the file was uploaded
LIST @CUSTOMER_360_STAGE;
```

#### **Step 3: Grant Permissions**
```sql
-- Grant usage on streamlit to role
GRANT USAGE ON STREAMLIT customer_360_ai_assistant TO ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;

-- Grant permissions to other roles as needed
GRANT USAGE ON STREAMLIT customer_360_ai_assistant TO ROLE [YOUR_ROLE];
```

---

## üîß **Configuration Steps**

### **1. Verify Database Setup**
Make sure your database is properly set up:

```sql
-- Check if all tables exist
SHOW TABLES IN CUSTOMER_360_DB.PUBLIC;

-- Check if all functions exist
SHOW FUNCTIONS IN CUSTOMER_360_DB.PUBLIC;

-- Test a function
SELECT analyze_customer_ai('CUST_001');
```

### **2. Test Data Access**
```sql
-- Verify customer data
SELECT COUNT(*) as customer_count FROM customers;

-- Check sample data
SELECT * FROM customers LIMIT 5;

-- Verify activities
SELECT COUNT(*) as activity_count FROM customer_activities;
```

### **3. Set Proper Permissions**
```sql
-- Grant select on all tables to the app role
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA CUSTOMER_360_DB.PUBLIC TO ROLE [YOUR_ROLE];

-- Grant usage on all functions
GRANT USAGE ON ALL FUNCTIONS IN SCHEMA CUSTOMER_360_DB.PUBLIC TO ROLE [YOUR_ROLE];

-- Grant usage on warehouse
GRANT USAGE ON WAREHOUSE CUSTOMER_360_WH TO ROLE [YOUR_ROLE];
```
